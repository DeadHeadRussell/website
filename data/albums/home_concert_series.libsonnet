    These performances mimic as if I was playing a concert.  They will typically be 30mins to 1 hour, and go through a series of songs and improvisations, just like I would playing anywhere.  Post processing will be done to cleanup the audio quality (eg, noise reduction, I live in a noisy apartment!) but generally not for editing or fixing mistakes.
