    At the start of COVID, everyone was looking for new hobbies to spend their
    free time at home with. Unfortunately for my wife, I decided to get a
    drumkit. At least it was an electronic one. Another topic that was big at
    the time was the effects of isolation and depression.
    <<break>>
    I had previously written about depression with No Light, in
    [[album:demos.fawm_2020|Feb. 2020]], right before COVID hit. No Light was written
    about friends I've seen deal with depression. I was also re-reading the
    Stormlight Archive in advance of the next novel, and it too has strong
    themes surrounding depression.
    <<break>>
    All of this influenced my drum practice, and ultimately lead me to write
    Chosen, an album about a fall into depression and the rise our of it,
    stronger than before.

  `, {}),
  createAlbum('rock_opera', 'Rock Opera', '???', 'A story about climate change leading to child slavery', `
    I started writing this Rock Opera sometime in the early-2010's. I don't
    really remember the exact date. I had recently been listening to The Who's
    Tommy and Quadrophenia and was very caught up in the overall flow of the
    music. I wanted to capture a similar essence with a story of my own.
    <<break>>
    It took me a while to get started. I didn't have a clue what to write about
    at first. It wasn't until I happened to be playing guitar one day, and
    played two of my older songs 'Farther Away' and 'Boy' back-to-back that I
    got an idea. The two songs fit well together musically, and the seeds of a
    story began. 'Farther Away' was written as a grade 12 English project.
    Instead of writing a book report, I was able to convince my English teacher
    to write a song about Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood and this rock opera
    has been heavily influenced by it. 'Boy', on the other hand, was an unnamed
    song from I don't even know when (yes, I know, I'm terrible at naming
    things). I first remember playing it during a lunch hour in Grade 9, though
    it probably did not have any lyrics back then. It was simply a song
    complaining about relationships, as highschool students are wont to do. I
    have also rewritten parts of its intro many times. From these two songs, I
    started writing.
    <<break>>
    Progress was slow until I started grad school at CMU. I was in the music and
    tech department and had the opportunity to take composition lessons as part
    of the program. It was here that my teacher, Nancy Galbraith, convinced me
    to leave my comfort zone and expand the arrangements. At first, I was just
    going to write it for my typical four piece band, but it got expanded to
    include the flute, viola, trumpet, percussion, and four part SATB vocals. I
    also made more progress here due to actually having weekly lessons where I
    was expected to make progress.
    <<break>>
    Now that I've finished writing all the songs and recorded the demos, what
    now? Well, I'm still not 100% completed. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm
    pretty terrible at naming things. Almost every song needs a new name, not
    to even mention the name of the whole thing. I am also not 100% happy with
    all of the lyrics, so some of them may still change. There are a few
    arrangement issues as well. From there?  Get it recorded I guess. Turn it
    into a musical?
    <<break>>
    Anyways, I hope you enjoy the demos (despite the fact that I'm singing all
    the parts, including the female vocals). I'd love to hear any feedback,
    questions, comments, etc, you have!
