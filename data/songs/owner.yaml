  The Girl, recently being sold, is introduced to her new owner. He tells her what her life will now be like, as she as terrified about what is happening.

lyrics: |
  [Owner]
  I am your owner,
  listen what I have to say.
  I'm in control here,
  I make sure you will obey.

  Your job is to beg on the streets.
  Come back here at the end of the day.
  I will make you obey.

  [Girl]
  Why, is this happening to me.
  I wish, that I could be free.
  If, I should try to flee.
  I would be beaten or worse maybe even be killed.

  I'm, feeling hunger pangs.
  But I, have no money to pay.
  I, would like to eat today.
  I have to steal some food or I will not get my fill.

  [Owner]
  You have done well,
  but there is room for much more.
  Let the men grab you,
  and lead you up into their floor.

  Once up there we will come for you.
  We will not let you come to harm.
  Just make sure to act your role.

  [Girl]
  I, am too scared to imagine.
  Though he, said nothing would happen.
  Please, let him burst through the door.
  This is it, nothings left, I cannot take anymore.
