      A song about climate change as request by my mom.
      This song follows the kishotenketsu structure to telling stories, both lyrically and musically.
      That structures the song into four sections, the intro, development, twist and conclusion.
      The tone of the lyrics was inspired by Petrichor by Phish.

    lyrics: `
      [Life as it currently is]
      a derelict building
      discovered out while hunting
      its crumbling to the ground

      full of precious metals
      then packed into the bottles
      we recently found

      whoa
      searching every day
      whoa

      another home is finished
      from materials scavenged
      for families growing
      this village lives and breathes

      whoa
      expanding every day
      whoa

      [Origin myth of society]
      winds start rushing
      cold from the ocean
      freezes the pilgrim's trail
      whoa

      pilgrimage to glaciers
      to view the frozen life
      this is where we emerged
      we were born of ice


      [The calamity]
      Skies shorn thunder
      Hurricanes tore cross land
      Shores went under
      Glaciers cut into sand

      Cities stood abandoned
      Lifeless sweeps of land
      Normal was supplanted
      All cause our need to expand


      [The cycle of life]
      whoa
      searching every day
      whoa

      whoa
      expanding every day
      whoa

      whoa
      forgetting every day
      whoa

      whoa
      greed every day
      whoa

      A pleasant cup of joe
      A lovely place to walk
      A sparkling drift of snow

      A guitar that's in tune
      A pair of jeans that fit
      A song that you can croon
      A (brown) couch on which to sit

      It's the little things, the little things, the little things in life
      Yes, the little things, the little things, the little things in life
      It's the little things, the little things, the little things in life
      That make your heart sing

      Among the little things
      There's a bigger thing I know
      And that's the love you have for me
      That makes my heart just glow and glow

      [Verse]
      Rainy Sunday morning, its raining all afternoon
      Starting the day with a mug of hot cocoa
      Bringing my blanket with me to stay warm
      Nothing going on, got nowhere to go

      Misty windows
      No need to look outside
      Snuggled up nice
      With you by my side

      [Chorus]
      Nothing's perfect in this world
      But this is close as it can be
      Just you and me

      [Verse]
      Summer afternoon, sun beams over the land
      Walking outside with you hand in sweaty hand
      Stop for a picnic by the ocean, breezes blow
      In no rush, taking it slow

      Whispered words
      Nothing to hide
      Feeling comfortable
      With you by my side

      [Chorus]
      Nothing's perfect in this world
      But this is close as it can be
      Just you and me

      [Bridge]
      Lonely days
      I look for your return
      Missing feeling
      I just want to stand and cry
      I want you here right by my side

      [Chorus]
      Nothing's better than our world
      Nothing'll take us from this world
      Nothing's needed in our world
      Nothing's perfect in this world
      But this is close as it can be

    lyrics: `
      He was born of parents who did not get along
      Went with his mother when it all went wrong
      But then in a rage, his Dad took him back
      Stole him for a couple of years

      Now he sits in the chair, remembers some things
      Where he lived his high school years
      Took some mushrooms and jumped out of a tree
      At least he's alive and moving on

      Heart full of grief, head full of sorrow
      He goes stumbling, fumbling, bumbling toward tomorrow

      Learned to work cars doing auto detail
      Hung out with a gang, did more drugs
      Taught him to shoplift for food, for clothes
      He did this for a number of years

      Now he sits in the chair, remembers some things
      When he paid no rent and lived in the hills
      He did some more drugs, lost most of his teeth
      At least he's alive and moving on

      Heart full of grief, head full of sorrow
      He goes stumbling, fumbling, bumbling toward tomorrow

      Now he sits in the chair, remembers some things
      Laughs about his life on the run
      No drugs, no alcohol run through his veins
      He's glad he's alive and moving on

      Heart full of grief, head full of sorrow
      He goes stumbling, fumbling, bumbling
      Heart full of grief, head full of sorrow
      He goes stumbling, fumbling, bumbling toward tomorrow

      Let's take a walk, here through the earth and the sun
      The seasons still turning as ever they've done
      The sky is a sentry and evenings are long
      The footpath afire, the wind blowing strong

      Let's you and I, darling, keep blowing along

      There's photos of synthesis caught in a flash
      With colour erupting from palettes of ash
      The foliage fills our mind in a flood
      As pale as a vampire and redder than blood

      A richness of life from impoverished mud

      And for a small moment, my wife is a girl
      In a strawberry ripple of ice cream and swirl
      And she floats in a labyrinth that winds in its ways
      On a cloud of perfume in the summertime haze

      All lost in the red of a redolent maze

      Let's take a walk, you and I, wanderers both
      In a garden of journeys of promise and growth
      To the wings of the birds and the words of their song
      Our hearts all afire, the wind blowing strong

      Let's you and I, darling, keep blowing along

      You probably don't want to listen to this song.  You see, I was tasked to do the following:
      â€¢ A ska guitar bridge
      â€¢ Unleash my inner metalhead
      â€¢ Dramatic shift in dynamics
      â€¢ Gorgeous, rich layers
      â€¢ Take the "Wheels on the bus go round and round" motif into dark territory
      â€¢ Use a keyboard quarter of piano, organ, celesta and harmonium, ala Mahler's no. 8
      â€¢ Use a flugelhorn (ok ok, I actually used a trumpet and eq'd it to make it sound somewhat similar...)

      I was also tasked, but failed, to do:
      â€¢ Melodic runs in the left hand of the piano - I simply forgot!
      â€¢ Simultaneous shifts in key and time signature - just didn't have the energy to put this together

      Needless to say... its an interesting piece ðŸ™‚
