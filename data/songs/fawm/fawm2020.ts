Or take some rhythmic pattern from the original theme and write a new theme that is based off of that rhythmic pattern. The possibilities are endless!\n\nHere is a Rachmaninoff: Variations on a Theme of Chopin (a different Chopin theme!). It is well worth the listen.\nhttps://youtu.be/XiDtLscGnn8\n\nPerformed by myself. Err... mostly. Kind of. Every note here was played on a piano. Just... usually really slowly, and one hand at a time. Or sometimes even multiple takes for a single hand. And then edited heavily after that.\n",
