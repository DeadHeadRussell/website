     "description": "Written for an employee at my company as an award for winning a hackathon. The three inspirations I was given were:\n- Shipyards by The Lake Poets\n- Evanescence\n- Female vocals\n\nGenerally, I write very negative lyrics. I guess its an outlet or something. Anyways, I tried to keep these lyrics really positive as it I didn't want to write a really dark song for an employee! But if this is as positive as I get, should I be concerned?\n",
