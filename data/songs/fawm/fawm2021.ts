Here are all my plates…\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow in the world did I let it get this bad?\nHow is she still putting up with me?\nIs this precisely why she chose my lunchtime\nTo grace me with her grand creativity?!\n\n[Chorus]\nMusey stole my lunch\nI was so hungry\nBut the perfect chord\nAnd the perfect word\nJust whacked me upside the head\n\n[Out]\nNow my soup is cold\nAnd my bread is stale\nStomach is growling\nBut I must obey\nOr I just might wake up dead\n",

That is up to the listener to decided.\n\nA 10x10 is 10, 10 second songs in a row. They don't have to be linked in any way, but in this case they are.\n\nI started by improv'ing the electric guitar, then layered everything else beneath it, mostly improv, but a couple retakes here and there. And well, since its me... its more like a 15x10 since everything I do ends up long. I also picked up some new synths a few days ago, so of course I had to use them here!\n",
