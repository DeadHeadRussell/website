  The intro is set during the not-so-far-distant future in a region of the world that is being hit hard by climate change. The local farmers are struggling to grow their crops, leaving them with little money. Because of this, they have to turn to other means to survive.

  Farther Away starts with a mother lamenting about her living conditions. She recently sold her only daughter so that she would have enough money to struggle out a living. It has finally sunk in that she will never get to see her daugter again.

  This song is supposed to segue directly into Here We Are, but I just didn't record the demo that way for whatever reason.

  [Mother]

  Fly away my pretty darling.
  Fly away my little one.
  Fly away for now I must let you go.
  Times are hard, increasingly so.

  Look at this, see what you have done.
  Sold my child so I could just live on.
  Far away she will go.
  Far away, too far for me to go.

  These desolations that you have caused.
  You should stop meddling with nature's affairs.
  These hard times are from you and your.
  Why me? It's unfair.

  I am done, nothing to live for.
  You've taken it all away now.
  I am gone, there's no coming back now.
  You've taken everything away from me.

  These desolations that that you have caused.
  You should stop meddling with nature's affairs.
  These hard times are from you and your.
  Why me? It's unfair.

  Way-oh-way, farther away now.

  [Mother and Daughter]
  Way-oh-way, farther away now.
