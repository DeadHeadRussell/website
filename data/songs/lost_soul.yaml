  Nothing good lasts for long. The Girl is sold to the whorehouse where the Boy found her. Once again, the Girl's life is throw to tatters and she loses all hope that she will ever have a good life.

lyrics: |
  [Madam]

  You, have been, bought, and sold.
  Your time, with him, is done, and old.
  whoooa

  Your, worth is, more than what, you do.
  You are, too, valuable to, misuse.
  whoooa

  You, will go, across, the seas
  To where those men, that you beguille, live their life, with ease.
  whoooa

  Your, charm, will draw, in a stream.
  And you'll see, what it's like, to be used, as pleased.
  whoooa

  You, have been, bought, and sold.
  Your soul, is mine, until you, grow old.
  whooooa

  Your, charm will, bring the men, in droves.
  They will not wait, to take off, all of, your clothes.
  whooooa

  [Girl]

  Where, are you taking me now.
  Please, I would like to get out.
  I, have room for no more.

  I would rather die.
  Please, let my soul fly.
  Take me farther away.
