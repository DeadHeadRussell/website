lyrics: |
  Long times pass and short times hold
  To be lost in a town that I do not know
  Allies twist without a cause
  Where one cannot pause for too long
  Where they do not belong
  Why is it here is not clear

  Moving away during a storm
  Leaving what is not the norm
  Casting off those lifeless fires
  Forgetting all the liars; wasted time
  It wasn't worth a dime
  Such a worthless year
  Wasted here

  Lifeless nights are worse than before
  There is nothing great here to explore
  Waiting for the next strike to blow
  There is nothing here to show that is new
  Its the same polluted dew
  From here I should be gone
  Is all wrong
  Is all wrong
  Is all wrong
  Is all wrong
