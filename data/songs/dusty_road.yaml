  Note: Please don't listen to this song. My narration is terrible. Like... so bad that I'd like to blot it out of my memory entirely. Saying that...

  The new job for the girl is a sex scam. She attracts rich tourists who think they can have it all while her Owner bursts in their room before anything can happen and blackmails them for their money. The Girl is being well treated and fed during all this and her determination to make something out of her life grows.

  [Girl]

  Once we started this sex scam, life wasn't as bad.
  I got well fed. I had to look as lovely as a rose my owner would say.
  When some western man was in sight, I'd play my part.
  Smile so seductively that they couldn't resist.

  Working on the streets, smiling at the men.
  More that I attract, the happier he will be.
  Working mens' lusts, taking all their pay.
  That's my life, whoa, upon this dusty road.

  They'd walk up, and look around, knowing they were doing wrong.
  And I'd play all innocent, offer to sell them a flower.
  But that's not what they'd be there for, they'd want my flower.
  They'd gently take my hand, and lead me up to their room.

  Working on the streets, smiling at the men.
  More that I attract, the happier he will be.
  Working mens' lusts, taking all their pay.
  That's my life, whoa, upon this dusty road.

  It was always the same. The men would take their pants off.
  They'd take my hand and put it on their hard penis. I'd just smile as if I didn't understand.
  Without fail, my owner would bust in before anything else happened.
  It was all I could do to not laugh at the men as they went flaccid.

  Working on the streets, smiling at the men.
  More that I attract, the happier he will be.
  Working mens' lusts, taking all their pay.
  That's my life, whoa, upon this dusty road.
