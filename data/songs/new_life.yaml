  Flash back over, we are back in the present. After recounting her life to the Boy, she wants to just be left alone. The Boy refuses, wanting to help her out. He realises that he has to do something about this problem and vows to dedicate his life to it.

lyrics: |
  [Girl]
  Please, go away, haven't I suffered enough.
  Please, go away, I don't want to feel your touch.

  [Boy]
  No, I won't, go away, I'm going to get you some help.
  No, I am, here to stay, stay and look after your health.

  [Girl]
  How, can I trust, after what I've been through.
  All, hope is lost, what you say can't be true.

  [Boy]
  No, there is, always hope, even when life's at its worst.
  I, will work, towards a way, that your life can be reversed.

  I spent these many days without walking.
  I sepnt these many days without truth.
  I spent these many days without talking.
  I spent these many days without you.
  Without you, without you.
  I spent these many days without knowing.
  I spent these many days without you.

  I listened to the words you were saying.
  I listened to the words yet again.
  You told me all about your problems.
  I listened to the words that you said.
  That you said, that you said.
  You told me I was part of the problem.
  I listened to the words that you said.

  We've got a lot of problems.
  But yours is worth working on.

  We've got find the root of it all.
  We've got to find, the real cause.
  I know now, what to work towards.
  I know now, what I have to do.

  I'll spend these next days fighting for freedom.
  I'll spend these next days saving you.
  I'll spend these next days, spend these next days.
  I'll spend these next days for you.
