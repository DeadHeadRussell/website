  This is both song 5 and 6, as they flow directly into one another. The Boy, being banished to his room, complains to his friends while he does his school work. His friends try to pressure him to sneak out late at night to have some fun. The Boy is conflicted, not wanting to disobey even more, but eventually caves in and follows them out.

  Fast foward to later that night, the Boy and his friends are up to no good. They wind up at a whore house where his friends ask the Madam to treat him well. The madam takes the Boy to their newest possession, the Girl sold in the first song.

  This is the closing song of Act I.

  5. Friends

  [Friend]
  Come join us for a night on the town.
  We'll help forget what has brought you down.
  Oh come with us to help forget.

  Meet us at the diner at one.
  Then we'll go have some real fun.
  Oh come with us and have a night to not forget about.

  [Boy / Friend]
  I shouldn't / oh why not?
  It's not right / really??
  I should stay home / oh where's the fun in that.

  How can you? / Do what?
  Sneak out late? / What do you mean?
  And they don't know. / Why do they have to know anything.

  [Friend]
  What have they done for you?
  They lock you up in their little room.
  Oh come with us and get away.

  Don't leave until after dark.
  We'll get you back before the dawn.
  Oh come with us and we'll take good care of you.

  [Boy / Friend (Spoken)]
  My mother / what has she done?
  She is nice / to you?
  And helps me out. / What about your father?

  My fath... / Yeah, that's what we thought.
  Maybe I'll go.

  [Boy]
  I can't help but think this isn't right.
  But maybe they know what's good for me.
  I can see what's past these towering walls.
  Or wallow all alone.

  6. The Meeting

  [Madam]
  Welcome to our show, we're here to give you cheer.
  Take a look around, you will find it here.
  Tell us what you want, we will see to that.
  You leave satisfied, no where else is better.

  [Boy]
  I don't know, what I want, or even if its here.

  [Friend (Spoken)]
  Hey darling, this is his first time, you know how it is.
  Why don't you, uh, go get him something special.

  [Boy / Girl]
  How could they do this to a girl.
  She is just sixteen / I am just sixteen.

  How could they do this to a girl.
  How could they be so mean / They be so mean.

  How could they take this girl away, from her mother.
  I have a mother too / have a mother too.

  Her mother must be scared.
  She must be so afraid / I am so afraid.

  How could they do this to a human.
  I am human too / I am human too.

  I have to help my own kind.
  I have to help her out of here / help me out of here.

  I have to help...
