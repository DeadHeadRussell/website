The local farmers are struggling to grow their crops, leaving them with little money. Because of this, they have to turn to other means to survive.\nFarther Away starts with a mother lamenting about her living conditions. She recently sold her only daughter so that she would have enough money to struggle out a living. It has finally sunk in that she will never get to see her daugter again.\nThis song is supposed to segue directly into Here We Are, but I just didn't record the demo that way for whatever reason.\n",
