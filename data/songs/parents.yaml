description: |
  We follow the Boy as he arrives home after school. His father is there waiting for him, upset that he is so late. His father berates him for not working towards finding a career path as the Boy complains that he isn't given enough space. After being chewed out, the Boy overhears his mother questioning how they are raising their child.

  [Father]
  Boy, I am irate, you came home late, get to work.
  Boy, don't you forget, your schedule's set, you are in deep.

  Boy, now listen close, I won't speak twice, this is your price.
  Boy, you will not leave, you'll work at home, and see now friends.

  I will not tolerate insolence.
  This household's my domain.

  Boy, now grab your work, and head upstairs, start at once.
  Boy, don't you move, until you're done, ....

  [Boy]
  I, swear this won't happen again.
  I did not mean to cause no harm.
  I was trying to ask for.
  Some more time for myself.
  I swear this will be a one time thing.
  It will not repeat itself.
  Thought I would like more of my time.
  For... my... self...

  [Father]
  I will not be interrupted.
  Go, now leave me in peace.

  [Mother]
  Do you think that were too hard on him.
  Do you think that he could use a break.
  Yes, I think that he could use some space.
  It is not for us to decide his place.

  Now is the turning point of his life.
  We should not get in his way.

  [Boy]
  Mother, is that really true?
  I did not think....
  ...is that really true...

  [Mother / Boy]
  I he/I could, only have, room to breathe.

  [Mother]
  This is his time to excel.
  He can work it out on his own.
  We should be there for support.
  And not to shape him ourselves.
