  One of the other slaves she lives with attempts to make an escape and pulls the Girl along. She is thrilled about getting away, but at the same time, she is terrified about being caught. The worst happens, and they are caught. The Girl quickly burst out crying that she was forced to go along. The owner lets her off the hook as he big plans for her, but the Girl never sees the other slave again...
