  We now fast forward a few years and find ourselves in a richer part of the world. Life looks great, families are well fed, well educated, and well entertained. This songs introduces to the protagonist of our story; a Boy in his senior year of highschool. He sings about his issues as he struggles to maintain a relationship.

  [Boy]
  Suzie what you did there I did see.
  It can't be undone it damaged me.
  Sarah I heard you knock me down.
  You threw me so close to the ground.

  Trying to find a better course
  But it always ends up worse.
  Keep on trying to make it be.
  But a heavy load just falls on me.

  Megan called me from the door.
  She did not want me anymore.
  Tessa hurt me in a whirl.
  She did not want to be my girl.

  Tearing my life to bits and pieces.
  But when I find good it just ceases.
  Keep on trying to restart.
  But my life just falls apart.
