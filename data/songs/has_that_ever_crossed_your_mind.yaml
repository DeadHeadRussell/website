  Straight up 3min Rock Song in 6/8
  I wrote this song while riding a bike. In fact, I wrote a second song on that bike ride as well. Life is silly sometimes.

lyrics: |
  I have shown you what you've never seen before
  I have helped you take your first walk 'cross the floor
  I have made sure that you've never fall'n behind
  Has that ever crossed your mind

  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da dee da

  In the time that was and time that swept away
  Once we were close now and we have gone astray
  One day I will be waiting you'll find
  Has that ever crossed your mind
  Has that ever crossed your mind
  Has that ever crossed your mind

  Left with pictures painted with a coarse hand
  Life is something that one cannot understand
  What you did I would never do in kind
  Has that ever crossed your mind
  Has that ever crossed your mind
  Has that ever crossed your mind

  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da da la dee da dee da
  La dee da dee da dee da
