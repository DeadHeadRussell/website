  7. Losing

  [Mother]

  Just last year, we lost our farm.
  The ocean got to high, from the storms.
  We didn't have no money, to eat at all.
  So our only daughter, we did sell.

  I wish I could soar, into the sky.

  The storms are getting worse, they won't abate.
  All the other towns, they share this fate.
  We've got nothing left, nothing to do.
  No one we know, no where to go.

  I wish I could soar, into the sky.
