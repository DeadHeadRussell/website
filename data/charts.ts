You‚Äôve got that look in your eye
         G
Like you think that I want it, too

But I just don‚Äôt know it yet
Am7           D7
I‚Äôve got that nasty feeling
     Em7
That I‚Äôm on a ride
        E7
And I‚Äôm just holding on
Am7             Cadd6
You‚Äôve got that look in your eye
          G
Like the second you get it
           G‚ôØ–æ
You‚Äôre gone


Chorus
Am7         F‚ôØ√∏7
Please understand why I‚Äôm pensive
Em7
Ulterior motives will outlive 

What I can give
Am7                   F‚ôØ√∏7
Pretty soon I‚Äôll have nowhere to go
G    
And quid pro quo
         G‚ôØ–æ7
Is gonna overflow the status quo
`,
`Verse 2
You‚Äôve got that devious smile
Like you know that I‚Äôm trapped
That I‚Äôm right where you want me
You‚Äôve got that devious smile
Like you‚Äôve already won
And you‚Äôre flaunting your victory
I‚Äôve got that trapped mentality
I can‚Äôt leave 
Or I‚Äôm the villain
You‚Äôve got that devious smile
Now I don‚Äôt even know you
And I‚Äôm taking it on the chin

Tell me, what do they see?

C‚ôØm7      
Saturday morning,
                            B‚ô≠–æ7
the sun reaching through my eyes
                Amaj7
And what will I find
                             G‚ôØ7
When I open them, will I see you

Laying there beside me
Arms reaching out
Or will I be without?
I never know, that‚Äôs what you do to me

You there spending time with me

You walk through that door
Don‚Äôt even say a thing

If there‚Äôs one thing I could change
If there‚Äôs something I could say
If there‚Äôs nothing I can do
To be there with you
