Em7
Ulterior motives will outlive 

What I can give
Am7                   F♯ø7
Pretty soon I’ll have nowhere to go
G    
And quid pro quo
         G♯о7
Is gonna overflow the status quo

`Verse 2
You’ve got that devious smile
Like you know that I’m trapped
That I’m right where you want me
You’ve got that devious smile
Like you’ve already won
And you’re flaunting your victory
I’ve got that trapped mentality
I can’t leave 
Or I’m the villain
You’ve got that devious smile
Now I don’t even know you
And I’m taking it on the chin

The morning whispers come through

my window

Listening is how I see

I hear the footsteps of a stranger

Walking along the streets

The whispers continue through
      the afternoon
The sounds never cease
The distant murmurs are overwhelmed
By the whisper of the streets
Listen to the murmurs
Tell me, what do they see?

C♯m7      
Saturday morning,
                            B♭о7
the sun reaching through my eyes
                Amaj7
And what will I find
                             G♯7
When I open them, will I see you

Laying there beside me
Arms reaching out
Or will I be without?
I never know, that’s what you do to me

You there spending time with me

If there’s one thing I could change

And how much time we spend together

Searching in the evening

Searching under the moon

Searching for you

You walk through that door
Don’t even say a thing
Not even a smile
Nothing I can latch right onto
Nothing I can trust

If there’s one thing I could change
It would be you and me
And how much time we spend together

If there’s something I could say
It would come out of my heart
The problem is I don’t know where to
start

If there’s one thing I could change
If there’s something I could say
If there’s nothing I can do
To be there with you
