        [Verse 1]
        I'm awake but in my mind
        I am falling down
        Falling to the ground

        I'm awake but in my mind
        I am falling down
        Falling right down

        Whenever the stars come out
        Walking along the water
        Whenever the stars come out
        Oh I think about falling down

        [Verse 2]
        I'm asleep but in my eyes
        The sun is bright
        The sun is real bright

        I'm asleep but in my eyes
        The sun is bright
        Shining real bright

        The moon begins to fade
        I lay to rest in my home
        Oh the moon begins to fade
        And the sun starts shining in my eyes

        [Verse 3]
        The sun goes down and I arrive
        I arrive at work
        Another late night

        The sun goes down and I arrive
        I arrive at work
        Working late nights

        Whenever the stars come out
        Walking along the water
        Whenever the stars come out
        I think about falling down
        Yeah I think about falling down
        Oh I think about falling down
        Oh I think about falling down

        [Verse 1]
        I'm surrounded by thieves and leeches and scum
        I have brought this on myself
        I am least removed from the comforts and values of home
        And now I live and breathe in stealth
        I'm distracted by lust and by avarice and sloth
        I'm witnessing and hold my tongue
        Strangers profit by my poorly guarded heart and treasure
        It seems my death bell has rung
        I want to escape to the sky

        [Verse 2]
        They rebuff and counter every bit of grace I offer
        Only conquest never trade
        And any sentiment is cast aside
        Any debt will go unpaid
        And I lie restless while the bastards gently slumber
        In the bed that I have made
        I want to escape, want to fly

        [Chorus]
        Gonna escape now, gonna escape
        Gonna escape now, gonna escape
        Gonna escape now, gonna escape
        Gonna escape now, yeah yeah
        I'm going to escape, going to fly

        [Verse 3]
        There may never be a greener pasture
        My next haven may not be safe
        I will leave, I will be searching
        I'm out of time to wait
        I'm going to escape, gonna try

        From a valley of helpless self implosion

        I am riding the wave of a body in motion
        I can taste
        Of the nectar of self determination
        And I am free
        Of the specter of all my dark fixations

        And waves of terror wash over me
        But they will carry me to shore

        I am safe
        From the perils of demons of my making
        And I'm alive
        And nothing is free but its there for taking
        Night falls
        But I know that a light is shining somewhere
        Day breaks
        And I know that I can find it somewhere

        Rays of hope illuminate me
        And they light my way

        They will carry me to shore

        You got that look in your eye
        Like you think that I want it too

        I've got that nasty feeling
        I'm on fire and I'm just holding on

        You've got that look in your eye
        Like the second you get it you're gone

        Please understand why I'm so pensive
        Ulterior motives will outlive what I can give
        Pretty soon I'll have nowhere to go
        Quid pro quo is going to overflow the status quo

        [Verse 2]
        You've got that devious smile
        Like you know that I'm trapped
        That I'm right where you want me
        You've got that devious smile
        Like you already won
        And you're flaunting your victory

        I've got that trapped mentality
        I can't leave or I'm the villain

        I may be concious
        But I'm a lumbering fool
        I may have decisions to make
        But I blindly follow my rule

        Eyes are glazed
        And my mind is slow
        Jaw hinge slack
        I need something to make me go go go

        [Pre-Chorus]
        Somethings always there for me
        To replenish my energy
        Could be gentle, could be bold
        It's all worth its weight in gold
        
        [Chorus]
        It's my precious bean
        It helps me get through my day
        I will make a scene
        For my precious bean

        [Verse 2]
        I may be weary
        But know to keep my chin up
        When life beats my down
        I can latch on to another cup

        Eyes are white
        And the world is a colourful song
        Coming alive
        I know it won't be long long long

        It's my precious bean
        From my precious caf√©

        You've been burying your head beneath sand

        It won't always be dry where we stand

        There are clouds in the twilight

        I could say that we're calming now
        But I don't know my words would be true

        You're just like the ocean
        I'm drawn by my fear
        Here we are sailing free
        A tumultuous sea you and me

        Don't be surprised that we're stranded
        You were the one that changed course

        You can reach hurricane force

        I just solved a mystery

        I inspected the scene of a crime

        And the culprit was you

        Going through my conversion
        Done with toxic immersion
        Placing faith in a better place
