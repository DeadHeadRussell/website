# Personal Website

![Website Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/DeadHeadRussell/website/master/Servers/data/images/personalProjects/Personal%20Website.png)

This is my personal website. On it, you can browse through various musical and software projects of mine. I am currently working on a subscription based system in which a user can sign up for update notifications.

## Running

My website has the following dependencies:
* node.js
* bash or windows cmd

To launch the server, run:
```bash
cd <project_dir>/Servers/node
node main.js <port_number>
```

To minify the client code, run:
```bash
cd <project_dir>/Clients
./build.sh
```
By default, the HTML files look for the minified versions of the JavaScript and CSS.

Testing something out.
